    "Conditions are used to check whether a certain statement is true or false. \n",

    "In Python, the colon \":\" is used to indicate the start of a block of code. All following lines that belong to that code block are then indented by four spaces (usually one tabulator-press). This is the way, Python interprets, which lines of code belong together and is a must. Otherwise, your code will throw errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure - a colon followed by intended lines - happens whenever you want to check for a condition, loop over something, create a function or a class. \n",
