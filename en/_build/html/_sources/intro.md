# Python course - Data Literacy at TU Dortmund University

This is a small Python Tutorial, which will teach you the basics of the Python 
programming language, its syntax and most common packages.

You can complete this course in your browser, without the need to install Python
on your local machine. If you want to use Python in the future, we also provide
a small guide on how to install Python and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) on your local machine at the end of the course.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send us an email:
- Kai-Robin Lange ([kalange@statistik.tu-dortmund.de](mailto:kalange@statistik.tu-dortmund.de))
- Henrik Hardering ([henrik.hardering@tu-dortmund.de](mailto:henrik.hardering@tu-dortmund.de))

```{attention}
To edit and run the Python code in this course, you will find this ![live code symbol](code_symbol.PNG) symbol on the top of each page that contains Python code. You can click on it and then choose "Live code" to edit and run code yourself. Please feel free to test different things out and play around with the code. You cannot break anything here and nobody (including us) can see your code, so feel free to experiment.
