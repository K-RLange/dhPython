# Python course - Data Literacy @TU Dortmund

This is a small Python Tutorial, which will teach you the basics of the Python 
programming language.

We will first teach you, how to install Python and an IDE (Integrated 
Development Environment) on your personal system and will then teach you the 
basics of the language, its syntax and most common packages.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send us an email:
- Kai-Robin Lange (kalange@statistik.tu-dortmund.de)
- Henrik Hardering (henrik.hardering@tu-dortmund.de)

Installing Python on your local hardware is not strictly neccessary for this course, as all code can be run in your browser. 
It is still recommended, if you want to continue working with Python later on.
To edit and run the Python code in this course, you will find this ![live code symbol](code_symbol.PNG) symbol on the top of each page that contains Python code. You can click on it and then choose "Live code" to edit and run code yourself. Please feel free to test different things out and play around with the code. You cannot break anything here and nobody (including us) can see your code, so feel free to experiment.


If you are interested in learning about corpus linguistics, we suggest you to
first complete this little course and then take a look at 
[this NLP-course](https://github.com/K-RLange/dhNLP).
