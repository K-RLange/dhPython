# Python for digital humanities @UA Ruhr

This is a small Python Tutorial, which will teach you the basics of the Python 
programming language.

We will first teach you, how to install Python and an IDE (Integrated 
Development Environment) on your personal system and will then teach you the 
basics of the language, its syntax and most common packages.

If you are interested in learning about corpus linguistics, we suggest you to
first complete this little course and then take a look at 
[this NLP-course](https://github.com/K-RLange/dhNLP).
